  simplicity: |
    ## Additional guidance
    Prioritize simplicity — find the smallest possible MVP that still demonstrates
    the full pipeline. Minimize dependencies and moving parts. Question whether each
    component is truly needed. Fewer files is better.

  framework-depth: |
    ## Additional guidance
    Focus on framework and library patterns. Show detailed code examples for each
    pipeline phase. Include exact imports, error handling patterns, and how key
    libraries work together. Show code, not just descriptions.

  k8s-ops: |
    ## Additional guidance
    Focus on deployment depth and operability. Include exact deployment commands
    with flags, resource configuration, environment setup, and operational
    runbooks. Document infrastructure decisions with comparative data where
    relevant.
